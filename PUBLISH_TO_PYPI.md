## üß™ Optional: Test on TestPyPI First

If you want to test before publishing to production PyPI:

python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ repo-tickets
```

Note: TestPyPI needs `--extra-index-url` for dependencies like click, pyyaml, etc.
