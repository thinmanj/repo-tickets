```

## How it works

Repo-tickets stores tickets as YAML files in a `.tickets/` directory in your repository root. This approach:

- Keeps tickets versioned alongside your code
- Allows tickets to be shared through normal VCS operations (push/pull/merge)
- Works offline and doesn't depend on external services
- Integrates naturally with your existing development workflow

## AI Agent System ðŸ¤–

Repo-tickets includes a sophisticated AI agent system for automated task management and coordination. Create specialized AI agents to handle different types of work, assign tasks automatically, and track performance.

### Agent Types

- **developer** - Specialized in coding, implementation, and technical tasks
- **reviewer** - Focused on code review and quality assurance  
- **tester** - Handles testing, QA, and validation tasks
- **analyst** - Performs analysis, research, and documentation
- **documenter** - Creates and maintains documentation
- **project_manager** - Coordinates tasks and manages project workflows
- **general** - Can handle any type of task

### Creating Agents

```bash
# Create a developer agent with GPT-4
tickets agent create "CodeBot" \
  --description "AI developer specialized in Python and JavaScript" \
  --type developer \
  --max-tasks 3 \
  --model "gpt-4"

# Create a testing agent with Claude
tickets agent create "TestBot" \
  --description "AI testing agent for QA and automated testing" \
  --type tester \
  --max-tasks 5 \
  --model "claude-3-opus"
```

### Task Assignment

#### Manual Assignment
```bash
# Assign specific task to specific agent
tickets agent assign TICKET-1 AGENT-CODEBOT code \
  "Implement JWT authentication" \
  --priority high \
  --instructions "Create middleware, login endpoints, and API protection"
```

#### Automatic Assignment
```bash
# Let the system choose the best agent for the task
tickets agent auto-assign TICKET-2 test \
  "Write unit tests for authentication" \
  --priority medium
```

The auto-assignment system uses intelligent scoring to match:
- Agent type with task type
- Agent availability (current task load)
- Agent performance history
- Task priority and complexity

### Agent Management

```bash
# List all agents with status and metrics
tickets agent list

# View detailed agent information
tickets agent show AGENT-CODEBOT

# List all agent tasks across agents
tickets agent tasks

# Filter tasks by agent, ticket, or status
tickets agent tasks --agent AGENT-CODEBOT --status in-progress
```

### Agent Performance Tracking

Each agent automatically tracks:
- **Tasks completed/failed** - Success rate metrics
- **Execution time** - Average time per task type
- **Response time** - How quickly agents start tasks
- **Last activity** - Agent health monitoring
- **Task type breakdown** - Performance by task category

### Output Formats

Agent information supports multiple output formats:

```bash
# Table format (default)
tickets agent list

# JSON format for integration
tickets agent list --format json

# Simple format for scripts
tickets agent list --format simple
```

### Agent Integration

- **Ticket Assignment** - Agents can be assigned to tickets
- **Task Tracking** - Each ticket can have multiple agent tasks
- **Workflow Integration** - Agent tasks appear in reports and analytics
- **VCS Integration** - Agent data stored alongside tickets in `.tickets/agents/`

## Requirements Management ðŸ“‹

Repo-tickets provides comprehensive requirements management capabilities that integrate seamlessly with ticket tracking. Define formal requirements, write user stories, specify expected results, and create Gherkin acceptance tests.

### Requirements Types

#### Formal Requirements
Structured requirements with priorities, statuses, and acceptance criteria:

```bash
# Add a requirement
tickets requirements add TICKET-1 \
  --title "Password Security" \
  --description "Implement secure password validation" \
  --priority critical \
  --criteria "Minimum 8 characters" \
  --criteria "Must contain uppercase, lowercase, and numbers"
```

#### User Stories  
Agile user stories following the "As a..., I want..., so that..." format:

```bash
# Add a user story
tickets requirements story TICKET-1 \
  --persona "developer" \
  --goal "track time on tickets" \
  --benefit "I can provide accurate estimates" \
  --priority high \
  --points 8 \
  --criteria "Timer can be started and stopped" \
  --criteria "Time is recorded accurately"
```

#### Expected Results
Verifiable outcomes with success criteria:

```bash
# Add expected result
tickets requirements result TICKET-1 \
  --description "Login API responds within 500ms" \
  --method automated \
  --criteria "95% of requests complete under 500ms" \
  --criteria "Error rate below 0.1%"
```

#### Gherkin Scenarios
BDD-style acceptance tests using Given-When-Then format:

```bash
# Add Gherkin scenario
tickets requirements gherkin TICKET-1 \
  --title "Successful user login" \
  --given "I am on the login page" \
  --given "I have valid credentials" \
  --when "I enter username and password" \
  --when "I click the login button" \
  --then "I should be redirected to dashboard" \
  --tags authentication --tags smoke

# Or load from file
tickets requirements gherkin TICKET-1 --file login_scenarios.feature
```

### Requirements Analytics

The system automatically calculates comprehensive metrics:

- **Requirements Coverage**: % of requirements implemented/verified
- **Test Pass Rate**: % of Gherkin scenarios passing  
- **Acceptance Rate**: % of tickets meeting acceptance criteria
- **Story Point Velocity**: Completed points over time
- **Verification Methods**: Distribution of testing approaches

These metrics appear in:
- HTML reports with visual dashboards
- Status command output
- README status sections
- JSON exports for automation

### Workflow Integration

Requirements integrate with the entire ticket lifecycle:

```bash
# View requirements summary
tickets requirements list TICKET-1

# View detailed breakdown
tickets requirements list TICKET-1 --format detailed

# View only Gherkin scenarios
tickets requirements list TICKET-1 --format gherkin

# Mark results as verified
tickets requirements verify TICKET-1 RESULT-123 --notes "Performance testing complete"
```

### Status Tracking

**Requirements**: draft â†’ approved â†’ implemented â†’ verified
**Scenarios**: draft â†’ ready â†’ passing/failing â†’ blocked
**Expected Results**: pending â†’ verified/failed â†’ blocked

### Best Practices

1. **Start with User Stories** - Define value before implementation
2. **Write Testable Requirements** - Use measurable acceptance criteria
3. **Use Consistent Tagging** - Organize scenarios by feature, risk, type
4. **Keep Scenarios Focused** - One behavior per scenario
5. **Verify Early and Often** - Update status as work progresses

See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for comprehensive documentation and examples.

## Epic and Backlog Management ðŸŽ¯ðŸ“‹

Repo-tickets provides enterprise-grade epic planning and product backlog management, enabling professional Agile/Scrum workflows with complete traceability from business goals to development tasks.

### Epic Management

Epics represent large bodies of work that span multiple sprints and tickets. They provide high-level tracking for major features, initiatives, or business goals.

**Epic Lifecycle:** Draft â†’ Active â†’ Completed / Cancelled

```bash
# Create a comprehensive epic
tickets epic create "E-commerce Platform" \
  --description "Complete online shopping experience" \
  --priority critical \
  --owner "Product Team" \
  --target-version "v2.0" \
  --target-date "2024-12-31" \
  --estimated-points 200

# Manage epic relationships
tickets epic add-ticket ECOM-1 CART-1
tickets epic add-ticket ECOM-1 PAYMENT-1
tickets epic add-ticket ECOM-1 CHECKOUT-1

# Track epic progress
tickets epic show ECOM-1
tickets epic list --status active
```

**Epic Features:**
- Target versions and completion dates with overdue detection
- Goals and measurable success criteria
- Story point estimation and progress tracking
- Bidirectional ticket relationships
- Owner assignment and team coordination

### Product Backlog Management

The backlog system enables professional product management with prioritization scoring, sprint planning, and requirement tracking.

**Backlog Lifecycle:** New â†’ Groomed â†’ Ready â†’ In Progress â†’ Done / Cancelled

```bash
# Add items with comprehensive metadata
tickets backlog add "User Registration" \
  --type feature \
  --priority high \
  --story-points 8 \
  --business-value 90 \
  --effort-estimate 16 \
  --risk-level medium \
  --epic-id USER-1 \
  --component "Authentication" \
  --theme "User Onboarding"

# Prioritized listing (automatic scoring)
tickets backlog list

# Sprint planning filters
tickets backlog list --status ready
tickets backlog list --epic USER-1
tickets backlog list --sprint SPRINT-1
```

### Advanced Prioritization

Backlog items are automatically prioritized using a sophisticated scoring algorithm:

**Priority Score = (Base Priority Ã— 100) + Business Value - (Story Points Ã— 2)**

This balances:
- **Strategic Priority** (critical=4, high=3, medium=2, low=1)
- **Business Value** (1-100 scale of user/business impact)
- **Development Effort** (story points using Fibonacci scale)

Items are automatically sorted by priority score for optimal sprint planning.

### Sprint Planning Features

```bash
# Check sprint readiness
# Items are ready when they have:
# - Status: groomed or ready
# - Story points assigned
# - Acceptance criteria defined
tickets backlog list --status ready

# Convert ready items to development tickets
tickets backlog convert LOGIN-1 \
  --reporter "Product Manager" \
  --reporter-email "pm@company.com"

# This automatically:
# - Creates a full ticket with all metadata
# - Converts acceptance criteria to requirements
# - Links to the original backlog item
# - Updates backlog item status to "in-progress"
```

### Professional Workflows

**Epic Planning Workflow:**
1. Create epic with business goals and success criteria
2. Add backlog items and associate with epic
3. Prioritize and groom backlog items
4. Convert ready items to tickets for development
5. Track progress through epic dashboard

**Team Coordination:**
- **Product Owner**: Manages backlog priorities and business value
- **Scrum Master**: Reviews sprint readiness and team metrics
- **Developers**: Convert backlog items and implement features
- **Team**: Tracks epic progress and release planning

### Integration with Requirements

Epics and backlog items seamlessly integrate with the requirements system:

- **Backlog Items** can have acceptance criteria and definition of done
- **Epic Goals** become high-level success criteria  
- **Converted Tickets** automatically inherit requirements from backlog items
- **Traceability** from epic â†’ backlog item â†’ ticket â†’ requirements

### Analytics and Reporting

Comprehensive metrics for professional project management:

- **Epic Progress**: Story points completed, tickets closed, timeline tracking
- **Backlog Health**: Items ready for sprint, prioritization distribution
- **Sprint Metrics**: Velocity, burndown, completion rates
- **Team Performance**: Individual and team story point delivery

All metrics appear in HTML reports, status commands, and project dashboards.

See [EPICS.md](EPICS.md) for comprehensive documentation, CLI reference, and best practices.
