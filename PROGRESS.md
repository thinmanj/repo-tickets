### Phase 1.1: Caching Layer Implementation
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Commit:** 9d1caee

**Implementation Details:**
- Added thread-safe caching system using `RLock` for concurrent access
- Implemented TTL-based cache expiration (300 seconds default)
- Created cache for both tickets and index operations
- Added comprehensive cache statistics tracking
- Implemented automatic cache invalidation on data changes
- Added `tickets cache-stats` CLI command

**Code Changes:**
- `repo_tickets/storage.py`: Added 200+ lines of caching infrastructure
  - `_ticket_cache`: Dict storing ticket objects with timestamps
  - `_index_cache`: Cached index with TTL validation
  - `_cache_lock`: Thread-safe RLock mechanism
  - Cache management methods: get, set, invalidate, clear
  - Cache statistics tracking: hits, misses, evictions, hit rate
  
- `repo_tickets/cli.py`: Added `cache-stats` command
  - Display cache performance metrics
  - Show hit rate with color-coded indicators
  - Support JSON output format
  - Optional cache clearing with `--clear` flag

**Performance Impact:**
- **Cache Hits:** Zero I/O operations (in-memory lookup)
- **Cache Misses:** Standard file I/O + cache warming
- **Expected Improvement:** 10-100x for repeated queries
- **Hit Rate Target:** 70-90% for typical agent workflows

**Features:**
1. **TTL-Based Expiration**
   - 5-minute default TTL
   - Automatic eviction of stale entries
   - Prevents serving outdated data

2. **Thread-Safe Operations**
   - RLock for concurrent access
   - Safe for multi-agent scenarios
   - No race conditions on cache updates

3. **Smart Invalidation**
   - Automatic invalidation on `save_ticket()`
   - Automatic invalidation on `delete_ticket()`
   - Index cache invalidated on any ticket change

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Real-time hit rate calculation
   - Eviction tracking
   - Cache size monitoring
   - JSON export for analysis

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# View cache statistics
tickets cache-stats

# View as JSON
tickets cache-stats --format json

# Clear cache
tickets cache-stats --clear

# Disable caching (programmatic)
storage = TicketStorage(enable_cache=False)
```

**Example Output:**
```
üìä Cache Performance Statistics

Status: Enabled
Cache Size: 42 tickets

Performance:
  Hits: 150
  Misses: 30
  Evictions: 5

Hit Rate: üü¢ 83.3%
