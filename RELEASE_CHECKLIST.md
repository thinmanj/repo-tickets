## üìã Pre-Publication Steps

### 1. Install Build Tools

```bash
pip install --upgrade build twine
```

### 2. Clean Previous Builds

```bash
rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info
```

### 3. Build Distribution Packages

```bash
# Build source distribution and wheel
python3 -m build
```

This creates:
- `dist/repo-tickets-1.0.0.tar.gz` (source distribution)
- `dist/repo_tickets-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel)

### 4. Verify Package Contents

```bash
# Check what's included
tar -tzf dist/repo-tickets-1.0.0.tar.gz | head -20

# Verify wheel
unzip -l dist/repo_tickets-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### 5. Test Installation Locally

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv test_env
source test_env/bin/activate

# Install from local wheel
pip install dist/repo_tickets-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Test CLI
tickets --help
tickets init

# Test import
python3 -c "import repo_tickets; print('Import successful')"

# Deactivate and cleanup
deactivate
rm -rf test_env
```

### 6. Check Package with Twine

```bash
# Check for errors and warnings
twine check dist/*
```

Should output: `Checking dist/... PASSED`

```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Username: `__token__`
- Password: Your TestPyPI API token

Then test installation from TestPyPI:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ repo-tickets
```

### 8. Upload to PyPI (Production)

```bash
